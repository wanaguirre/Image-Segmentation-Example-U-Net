This repository is just to show and teach some Image Segmentation through a U-Net method to solve the [Carvana Image Masking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge).

# Image Segmentation Example (U-Net)

Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups, as you can see in the image below, where the task of the network is to assign a label or class to an input image.

There are various types of segmentation, however we will focus on single image semantic segmentation which basically focuses on pixel-wise segmentation, this is also because that is the propose of the exercise.

In this case you will want to segment the image, i.e., each pixel of the image is given a label. 

Thus, the task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level. 

Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging to name a few.

Techniques applied:
- Data Augmentation
- U-Net model
  - Encoder: MobileNetV2 model (Transfer learning)
  - Decoder: [Pix2pix](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/models/pix2pix/pix2pix.py)

### Task:

In this competition, you’re challenged to develop an algorithm that automatically removes the photo studio background. This will allow Carvana to superimpose cars on a variety of backgrounds.

### Methodology

  - **Data Augmentation**
    - The following code performs a simple augmentation of flipping an image. 
    - In addition,  image is normalized to [0,1].

   - **U-Net Model**
    - Encoder: MobileNetV2 model (Transfer learning)
    - Decoder: [Pix2pix](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/models/pix2pix/pix2pix.py)

The model being used here is a modified U-Net. A U-Net consists of an encoder (downsampler) and decoder (upsampler). In-order to learn robust features, and reduce the number of trainable parameters, a pretrained model can be used as the encoder. Thus, the encoder for this task will be a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, whose intermediate outputs will be used, and the decoder will be the upsample block already implemented in TensorFlow Examples in the [Pix2pix tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/models/pix2pix/pix2pix.py). 

The reason to output three channels is because there are three possible labels for each pixel. Think of this as multi-classification where each pixel is being classified into three classes.

  - **Segmentation - Training for 3 Epochs**
    - We are going to use Dice Coefficient (F1 Score) to validate our model. [Model metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-semantic-segmentation-model-6bcb99639aa2)

**Just with 3 epochs: val_loss: 0.0155 - val_dice_coef: 0.9845 - val_binary_accuracy: 0.9941**
